Instructions for installing Nelua on Windows or Linux.
{: .lead}

To install Nelua you need a system with the following:

* Git (for cloning Nelua)
* A C compiler (GCC or Clang are recommended)
* Build tools (such as make)
* GDB debugger (in case you want to debug runtime errors)

## Linux

Use your system's package manager to install all of the required tools first,

### Ubuntu
```sh
sudo apt-get install build-essential git gcc gdb
```

### Arch
```sh
sudo pacman -S based-devel git gcc gdb
```

## MacOS
first make sure you have installed **brew**, then run:
```
brew install gcc gdb git make
```

## Windows

MSYS2 is the recommended and supported environment to use Nelua on Windows.
Although you could use other tools, MSYS2 makes using Nelua very easy on Windows,
plus there are many useful C packages on MSYS2 that you can install with ease, such as
SDL2.

Download and install [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/).
After installing open the **64 bit terminal**, that is,
**msys64**, and update:

```sh
pacman -Syu
```

You may need close and reopen the terminal and update a second time using the same command.

Now install all the required tools first,
then clone, compile the dependencies, and install using make.

```sh
pacman -S base-devel git mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc gdb
```

## Clone and Install

now you can clone and install with:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/edubart/nelua-lang.git && cd nelua-lang
sudo make install
```

in linux this will install to `/usr/local` by default.
You can install somewhere else using the `PREFIX` argument.
For example, suppose you want to install in your home directory.
Then you would use `sudo make install PREFIX=~/nelua`,
and the Nelua compiler would be available at `~/nelua/bin/nelua`.

Alternatively you can run the `nelua.sh` file to run Nelua directly if you do not wish
to install it anywhere on your system.

Proceed to the [testing section](#testing).

## Testing

Nelua should be installed. Run `nelua -h` in your terminal to check if it is working.
If doesn't work, your environment `PATH` variable is missing the `bin` folder of the Nelua installation.
Add it or find and execute the full path to the installed Nelua compiler to use it.

Run the hello world example:

```sh
nelua examples/helloworld.nelua
```

You can run any file in the `examples` or `tests` directories,
play with them to test or to learn how to code in Nelua.

The most interesting examples are perhaps the graphical ones,
such as `snakesdl.nelua` and `condots.nelua`.

To run the Snake SDL game demo, for example, you will need to have the SDL2 library installed.
Install it using your system's package manager and run the example:

```sh
# install SDL2 on MSYS2
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-SDL2
# install SDL2 on Ubuntu
sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev
# run it
nelua examples/snakesdl.nelua
```
