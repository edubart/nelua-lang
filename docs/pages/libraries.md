This is a list of Nelua standard libraries.
{: .lead}

To use a library, use `require 'libraryname'`{:.language-nelua}.
{: .callout.callout-info}

## builtins

The following are builtin functions defined in the Nelua compiler.
Thus this is not really a library and shouldn't be used with `require`.

### require

```nelua
global function require(modname: string <comptime>)
```

Loads the given module `modname`.

The function starts by looking into loaded modules to determine whether `modname` is already loaded.
If it is then require does nothing, otherwise it tries to load the module.

If there is any error loading the module, then the compilation fails.
If there is any error running the module, then the application terminates.

### print

```nelua
global function print(...: varargs): void
```

Receives any number of arguments and prints their values to the standard output,
converting each argument to a string following the same rules of `tostring`.
The values are separated by tabs and a new line is always appended.

The function `print` is not intended for formatted output,
but only as a quick way to show a value, for instance for debugging.
For complete control over the output, use `io.write` or `io.writef`.

### panic

```nelua
global function panic(message: string): void
```

Terminate the application abnormally with message `message`.
This function never returns.

Use to raise unrecoverable errors.

### error

```nelua
global function error(msg: string): void
```

Raises an error with message `message`.
This function never returns.

Currently this is an alias to `panic` and terminates the application,
but in the future, in case the language get an exception system,
it may be changed to an exception being thrown.

### assert

```nelua
global function assert(v: auto, message: facultative(string))
```

Raises an error if the value `v` is evaluated to `false`, otherwise, returns `v`.
In case of error, `message` is the error message, when absent defaults to `"assertion failed!"`.

### check

```nelua
global function check(cond: boolean, message: facultative(string)): void
```

If `cond` is true it does nothing, otherwise raises an error with `message` and terminates the application.
Similar to `assert` however it's completely omitted when compiling in release mode or with pragma `nochecks`.
Use for assertive programming, to check if conditions are met without impacting performance of production code.

### likely

```nelua
global function likely(cond: boolean): boolean
```

Returns `cond`. This is a branching prediction utility, expecting `cond` to evaluate to `true`.

### unlikely

```nelua
global function unlikely(cond: boolean): boolean
```

Returns `cond`. This is a branching prediction utility, expecting `cond` to evaluate to `false`.

### _VERSION

```nelua
global _VERSION: string
```

A string containing the running Nelua version, such as `"Nelua 0.2-dev"`.

---
## arg

The arguments library provides the global sequence `arg`,
which is filled with command line arguments on initialization.

### arg

```nelua
global arg: sequence(string, GeneralAllocator)
```

Sequence of command line arguments.

The value at index `0` is usually filled with the program executable name.
The values starting from index `1` up to `#arg` contains each command line argument.

---
## iterators

The iterators library provides iterators functions such as
`ipairs`, `pairs` and `next` to assist iterating over elements of a container.

The functions provided here can be used with the `for in` construction.

### ipairs

```nelua
global function ipairs(a: container_reference_concept): (auto, auto, integer)
```

Returns values so that the construction
```nelua
for i,v in ipairs(a) do body end
```
will iterate over the index–value pairs of `a` from its first element up to the last.
Where `i` is an integer determining the index of the element, and `v` its respective value.

The container `a` must be contiguous, such as `array`, `span`, `vector` or `sequence`.

### mipairs

```nelua
global function mipairs(a: container_reference_concept): (auto, auto, integer)
```

Like `ipairs` but yields reference to elements values so that you can modify them in-place.

### next

```nelua
global function next(a: container_reference_concept, k: auto): (auto, auto, auto)
```

Gets the next element after key `k` for the container `a`.

In case of success returns `true` plus the next element key and the next element value.
Otherwise returns `false` plus a zeroed key and value.

The container `a` must either have the metamethod `__next` or be a contiguous.

### mnext

```nelua
global function mnext(a: container_reference_concept, k: auto): (auto, auto, auto)
```

Like `next` but returns reference to the next element value, so that you can modify it in-place.

### pairs

```nelua
global function pairs(a: container_reference_concept): (auto, auto, auto)
```

Returns values so that the construction
```nelua
for k,v in pairs(a) do body end
```
will iterate over all the key–value pairs of `a`.
Where `k` is a key determining the location of the element, and `v` its respective value.

The container `a` must either have the metamethod `__pairs` or be a contiguous.
Should work on any container, such as `array`, `span`, `vector`, `sequence` or `hashmap`.

### mpairs

```nelua
global function mpairs(a: container_reference_concept): (auto, auto, auto)
```

Like `pairs` but yields reference to elements values so that you can modify them in-place.

### select

```nelua
global function select(index: auto <comptime>, ...: varargs)
```

If `index` is a number, returns all arguments after argument number index;
a negative number indexes from the end (`-1` is the last argument).
Otherwise, `index` must be the string '#',
and select returns the total number of extra arguments it received.

---
## io

The input and output library provides functions to manipulate files.

The library provides two different styles for file manipulation.
The first one uses implicit file handles,
that is, there are operations to set a default input file and a default output file,
and all input/output operations are done over these default files.
The second style uses explicit file handles.
When using implicit file handles, all operations are supplied by module `io`.

When using explicit file handles,
the operation `io.open` returns a file handle and
then all operations are supplied as methods of the file handle.

The io module also provides three predefined file handles with their usual meanings from C:

* `io.stdin`: default input file handle
* `io.stdout`: default output file handle
* `io.stderr`: default error output file handle

The I/O library never closes these files.

Unless otherwise stated, all I/O functions return a valid value on success,
otherwise an error message as a second result
and a system-dependent error code as a third result.

### io

```nelua
global io: type = @record{}
```

Namespace for I/O module.

### io.stderr

```nelua
global io.stderr: filestream
```

Default error output file handle.

### io.stdout

```nelua
global io.stdout: filestream
```

Default output file handle.

### io.stdin

```nelua
global io.stdin: filestream
```

Default input file handle.

### io.open

```nelua
function io.open(filename: string, mode: facultative(string)) : (filestream, string, integer)
```

Opens a file, in the mode specified in the string `mode`.
In case of success, it returns an open file.

Equivalent to `filestream:open(filename, mode)`.

### io.popen

```nelua
function io.popen(prog: string, mode: facultative(string)) : (filestream, string, integer)
```

Starts the program `prog` in a separated process and
returns a file handle that you can use to read data from this program
(if `mode` is "r", the default) or to write data to this program (if `mode` is "w").
This function is system dependent and is not available on all platforms.

### io.close

```nelua
function io.close(file: facultative(filestream)): (boolean, string, integer)
```

Closes a file.
Without a `file`, closes the default output file.

Equivalent to `file:close()`.

### io.flush

```nelua
function io.flush(): (boolean, string, integer)
```

Save any written data to the default output file.

Equivalent to `io.output():flush()`.

### io.input

```nelua
function io.input(file: overload(string,filestream,niltype)): filestream
```

When called with a file name, it opens the named `file` (in text mode), and sets its handle as the default input file.
When called with a file handle, it simply sets this file handle as the default input file.
When called without arguments, it returns the current default input file.

In case of errors this function raises the error, instead of returning an error code.

### io.output

```nelua
function io.output(file: overload(string,filestream,niltype)): filestream
```

Similar to `io.input`, but operates over the default output file.

### io.tmpfile

```nelua
function io.tmpfile(): (filestream, string, integer)
```

In case of success, returns an open handle for a temporary file.
This file is opened in update mode and it is automatically removed when the program ends.

### io.read

```nelua
function io.read(fmt: overload(integer,string,niltype)): (string, string, integer)
```

Read from default input, according to the given format.

Equivalent to `io.input():read(fmt)`.

### io.write

```nelua
function io.write(...: varargs): (boolean, string, integer)
```

Writes the value of each of its arguments to the standard output.
The arguments must be strings or numbers.
In case of success, this function returns `true`.

Equivalent to `io.output():write(...)`.

### io.writef

```nelua
function io.writef(fmt: string, ...: varargs): (boolean, string, integer)
```

Writes formatted values to the standard output, according to the given format.
In case of success, this function returns `true`.

Equivalent to `io.output():writef(fmt, ...)`.

### io.printf

```nelua
function io.printf(...: varargs): void
```

Like `io.writef` but also flushes the standard output.

### io.type

```nelua
function io.type(obj: auto): auto
```

Checks whether `obj` is a valid file handle.
Returns the string `"file"` if `obj` is an open file handle,
`"closed file"` if `obj` is a closed file handle,
or `nil` if `obj` is not a file handle.

### io.lines

```nelua
function io.lines(filename: facultative(string), fmt: overload(integer,string,niltype))
```

Opens the given file name in read mode
and returns an iterator function that works like `file:lines(...)` over the opened file.

The call `io.lines()` (with no file name) is equivalent to `io.input():lines("l")`,
that is, it iterates over the lines of the default input file.

It currently never closes the file when the iteration finishes.
In case of errors opening the file, this function raises the error, instead of returning an error code.

---
## filestream

The file stream library provides the `filestream` record,
mostly used by the `io` library to manage file handles,
but can also be used independently.

### filestream

```nelua
global filestream: type = @record{
  fs: *FStream
}
```

File stream record, used to store file handles.

### filestream._fromfp

```nelua
function filestream._fromfp(fp: *FILE, closef: function(fp: *FILE): cint): filestream
```

Initialize a new `filestream` from a given C `FILE` pointer.
`closef` is a callback to call when closing the file handle.

This function is used internally.

### filestream:_getfp

```nelua
function filestream:_getfp(): *FILE
```

Returns a C `FILE` pointer for the filestream.
In case the file is closed, returns `nilptr`.

This function is used internally.

### filestream.open

```nelua
function filestream.open(filename: string, mode: facultative(string)) : (filestream, string, integer)
```

Opens a file, in the mode specified in the string `mode`.
In case of success, it returns an open file.
Otherwise, returns a closed file handle, plus an error message and a system-dependent error code.

The mode string can be any of the following:

* `"r"`: read mode (the default);
* `"w"`: write mode;
* `"a"`: append mode;
* `"r+"`: update mode, all previous data is preserved;
* `"w+"`: update mode, all previous data is erased;
* `"a+"`: append update mode, previous data is preserved, writing is only allowed at the end of file.

The mode string can also have a 'b' at the end, which is needed in some systems to open the file in binary mode.

### filestream:flush

```nelua
function filestream:flush(): (boolean, string, integer)
```

Saves any written data to file.

Returns `true` on success, otherwise `false` plus an error message and a system-dependent error code.

### filestream:close

```nelua
function filestream:close(): (boolean, string, integer)
```

Closes the file.

Returns `true` on success, otherwise `false` plus an error message and a system-dependent error code.

### filestream:destroy

```nelua
function filestream:destroy(): void
```

Destroys a file stream freeing its memory.
If the file still open, it's silently closed.

This function is only needed to be called when not using the GC.

### filestream:__close

```nelua
function filestream:__close(): void
```

Effectively the same as `destroy`, called when a to-be-closed variable goes out of scope.

### filestream:seek

```nelua
function filestream:seek(whence: facultative(string), offset: facultative(integer)): (integer, string, integer)
```

Sets and gets the file position, measured from the beginning of the file,
to the position given by `offset` plus a base specified by the string `whence`, as follows:

* `"set"`: base is position 0 (beginning of the file)
* `"cur"`: base is current position
* `"end"`: base is end of file

In case of success, returns the final file position, measured in bytes from the beginning of the file.
If seek fails, it returns `-1`,  plus an error message and a system-dependent error code.

The default value for whence is `"cur"`, and for offset is `0`.
Therefore, the call `filestream:seek()` returns the current file position, without changing it.

The call `filestream:seek("set")` sets the position to the beginning of the file (and returns `0`).
The call `file:seek("end")` sets the position to the end of the file, and returns its size.

### filestream:setvbuf

```nelua
function filestream:setvbuf(mode: string, size: facultative(integer)): (boolean, string, integer)
```

Sets the buffering mode for a file. There are three available modes:

* `"no"`: no buffering.
* `"full"`: full buffering.
* `"line"`: line buffering.

For the last two cases, size is a hint for the size of the buffer, in bytes.
The default is an appropriate size.

The specific behavior of each mode is non portable,
check the underlying ISO C function `setvbuf` in your platform for more details.

Returns `true` on success, otherwise `false` plus an error message and a system-dependent error code.

### filestream:read

```nelua
function filestream:read(fmt: overload(integer,string,niltype)): (string, string, integer)
```

Reads the file file, according to the given formats, which specify what to read.

The function returns a string with the characters read.
Otherwise, if it cannot read data with the specified format, it
returns an empty string plus an error message and a system-dependent error code.

The available formats are:

* `"a"`: reads the whole file, starting at the current position.
On end of file, it returns the empty string, this format never fails.
* `"l"`: reads the next line skipping the end of line, returning fail on end of file.
* `"L"`: reads the next line keeping the end-of-line character (if present), returning fail on end of file.
* `integer`: reads a string with up to this number of bytes, returning fail on end of file.
If number is zero, it reads nothing and returns an empty string, or fail on end of file.

The formats `"l"` and `"L"` should be used only for text files.
When called without arguments, it uses the default format `"l"` that reads the next line.

### filestream:write

```nelua
function filestream:write(...: varargs): (boolean, string, integer)
```

Writes values to the file.
The arguments must be strings or convertible to string.

Returns `true` on success, otherwise `false` plus an error message and a system-dependent error code.

### filestream:writef

```nelua
function filestream:writef(fmt: string, ...: varargs): (boolean, string, integer)
```

Writes formatted values to the file, according to the given format.

Returns `true` on success, otherwise `false` plus an error message and a system-dependent error code.

### filestream:lines

```nelua
function filestream:lines(fmt: overload(integer,string,niltype)): (auto, auto, string)
```

Returns an iterator function that, each time it is called, reads the file according to the given format.
When no format is given, uses `"l"` as a default. As an example, the construction
```nelua
for c in file:lines(1) do body end
```
will iterate over all characters of the file, starting at the current position.

### filestream:isopen

```nelua
function filestream:isopen(): boolean
```

Checks whether the file is open.

### filestream:__tostring

```nelua
function filestream:__tostring(): string
```

Convert the file handle to a string.
Returns `"filed (closed)"` for invalid or closed files,
and `"file (some address)"` for open files.

This metamethod is used by `tostring`.

### math.randomseed

```nelua
function math.randomseed(x: an_optional_integral, y: an_optional_integral): (integer, integer)
```

When called with at least one argument,
the integer parameters `x` and `y` are joined into a 128-bit seed that is used
to reinitialize the pseudo-random generator.
Equal seeds produce equal sequences of numbers. The default for `y` is zero.

When called with no arguments, generates a seed with a weak attempt for randomness.

This function returns the two seed components that were effectively used,
so that setting them again repeats the sequence.

To ensure a required level of randomness to the initial state
(or contrarily, to have a deterministic sequence, for instance when debugging a program),
you should call `math.randomseed` with explicit arguments.

### math.random

```nelua
function math.random(m: an_optional_scalar, n: an_optional_scalar): auto
```

When called without arguments, returns a pseudo-random float with uniform distribution in the range [`0`,`1`).
When called with two integers `m ` and `n`, returns a pseudo-random integer with uniform distribution in the range [`m`, `n`].

The call `math.random(n)`, for a positive `n`, is equivalent to `math.random(1,n)`.
The call `math.random(0)` produces an integer with all bits (pseudo)random.

This function uses an algorithm based on *xoshiro256* to produce pseudo-random 64-bit integers,
which are the results of calls with argument 0.
Other results (ranges and floats) are unbiased extracted from these integers.

Its pseudo-random generator is initialized with the equivalent of a call to `math.randomseed` with no arguments,
so that `math.random` should generate different sequences of results each time the program runs.

### math.pi

```nelua
global math.pi: number
```

Float value of PI.

### math.huge

```nelua
global math.huge: number
```

Float value greater than any other numeric value (infinite).

### math.mininteger

```nelua
global math.mininteger: integer
```

An integer with the minimum value for an integer.

### math.maxinteger

```nelua
global math.maxinteger: integer
```

An integer with the maximum value for an integer.

### math.maxuinteger

```nelua
global math.maxuinteger: uinteger
```

An integer with the maximum value for an unsigned integer.

## memory

The memory library provides low level memory management utilities.

The user is responsible to use valid pointers and memory regions for the library functions,
otherwise the user may experience crashes or undefined behaviors at runtime.
To assist finding such mistakes some checks are performed where applicable, which can
be disabled with the pragma `nochecks`.

### memory

```nelua
global memory: type = @record{}
```

Namespace for memory module.

### memory.copy

```nelua
function memory.copy(dest: pointer, src: pointer, n: usize): void
```

Copies `n` bytes from memory pointed by `src` into memory pointed by `dest`.
If `n` is zero, then nothing is done.

The memory region may not overlap, use `memory.move` in that case.

### memory.move

```nelua
function memory.move(dest: pointer, src: pointer, n: usize): void
```

Copies `n` bytes from memory pointed by `src` into memory pointed by `dest`.
The memory region may overlap.
If `n` is zero, then nothing is done.

If the memory region is guaranteed to not overlap, then you could use `memory.copy`.

### memory.set

```nelua
function memory.set(dest: pointer, x: byte, n: usize): void
```

Fills first `n` bytes of the memory pointed by `dest` with the byte `x`.
If `n` is zero, then nothing is done.

```

Fills first `n` bytes of the memory pointed by `dest` with zeros.
If `n` is zero, then nothing is done.

### memory.compare

```nelua
function memory.compare(a: pointer, b: pointer, n: usize): int32
```

Compares the first `n` bytes of the memory areas pointed by `a` and `b`.

Returns an integer less than, equal to, or greater than zero if the first `n` bytes
of `a` is found, respectively, to be less than, to match, or be greater than the first `n` bytes of `b`.

The sign is determined by the sign of the difference between the first pair of bytes that differ in `a` and `b`.

If `n` is zero, the return value is zero.

### memory.equals

```nelua
function memory.equals(a: pointer, b: pointer, n: usize): boolean
```

Check if the first `n` bytes of the memory areas pointed by `a` and `b` are equal.

Returns `true` if the first `n` bytes of `a` is equal to the first `n` bytes of `b.

If `n` is zero, the return value is `true`.

## os

The os library provides some operating system facilities.

Some `os` functions behavior may vary across different operating systems,
or may not be supported.

### os

```nelua
global os: type = @record{}
```

Namespace for OS module.

### os.clock

```nelua
function os.clock(): number
```

Returns an approximation of the amount in seconds of CPU time used by the program,
as returned by the underlying ISO C function `clock`.

### os.date

```nelua
function os.date(format: facultative(string), formattime: facultative(integer)): string
```

Returns a string or a table containing date and time,
formatted according to the given string `format`.

If the `formattime` argument is present, this is the time to be formatted
(see the `os.time` function for a description of this value).
Otherwise, `date` formats the current time.

If `format` starts with '!', then the date is formatted in UTC (Coordinated Universal Time).
After this optional character, the date is
formatted according to the same rules as the ISO C function `strftime`.

If `format` is absent, it defaults to "%c",
which gives a human-readable date and time representation using the current locale.

On non-POSIX systems, this function may be not thread safe
because of its reliance on C function `gmtime` and C function `localtime`.

### os.difftime

```nelua
function os.difftime(t2: integer, t1: integer): number
```

Returns the difference, in seconds, from time `t1` to time `t2`
(where the times are values returned by `os.time`).

In POSIX, Windows, and some other systems, this value is exactly `t2 - t1`.

### os.execute

```nelua
function os.execute(command: facultative(string)): (boolean, string, integer)
```

Passes command to be executed by an operating system shell.

Its first result is `true` if the command terminated successfully, or `false` otherwise.
After this first result the function returns a string plus a number, as follows:

 * `"exit"`: the command terminated normally; the following number is the exit status of the command.
 * `"unsupported"`: executing command is not supported in the system.

When called without a command, `os.execute` returns a boolean that is `true` if a shell is available.

This function is equivalent to the ISO C function `system`.
This function is system dependent and is not available on all platforms.

### os.exit

```nelua
function os.exit(code: overload(integer,boolean,niltype)): void
```

Calls the ISO C function `exit` to terminate the host program.

If `code` is `true`, the returned status is `EXIT_SUCCESS`.
If `code` is `false`, the returned status is `EXIT_FAILURE`.
If `code` is a number, the returned status is this number.
The default value for code is `true`.

### os.setenv

```nelua
function os.setenv(varname: string, value: facultative(string)): (boolean, string, integer)
```

Sets the value of the process environment variable `varname` to `value`.
In case the variable already exists, then it is overwritten, otherwise it is added.
If `value` is not present, then the variable is removed.

Returns `true` on success, otherwise `false` plus an error message and a system-dependent error code.

### os.getenv

```nelua
function os.getenv(varname: string): string
```

Returns the value of the process environment variable `varname`.
In case the variable is not defined, an empty string is returned.

### os.remove

```nelua
function os.remove(filename: string): (boolean, string, integer)
```

Deletes the file (or empty directory, on POSIX systems) with the given name.

Returns `true` on success, otherwise `false` plus an error message and a system-dependent error code.

### os.rename

```nelua
function os.rename(oldname: string, newname: string): (boolean, string, integer)
```

Renames the file or directory named `oldname` to `newname`.

Returns `true` on success, otherwise `false` plus an error message and a system-dependent error code.

### os.setlocale

```nelua
function os.setlocale(locale: facultative(string), category: facultative(string)): string
```

Sets the current locale of the program.

`locale` is a system-dependent string specifying a locale.
`category` is an optional string describing which category to change:
`"all"`, `"collate"`, `"ctype"`, `"monetary"`, `"numeric"`, or `"time"`;
the default category is "all".

If locale is the empty string, the current locale is set to an implementation-defined native locale.
If locale is the string `"C"`, the current locale is set to the standard C locale.

The function returns the name of the new locale on success,
or an empty string if the request cannot be honored.

### os.timedesc

```nelua
global os.timedesc: type = @record{
  year: integer, month: integer, day: integer,
  hour: integer, min: integer, sec: integer,
  isdst: boolean
}
```

Time description, used by function `os.time`.

### os.time

```nelua
function os.time(desc: facultative(os.timedesc)): integer
```

Returns the current time when called without arguments,
or a time representing the local date and time specified by the given time description.

When the function is called, the values in these fields do not need to be inside their valid ranges.
For instance, if sec is -10, it means 10 seconds before the time specified by the other fields.
If hour is 1000, it means 1000 hours after the time specified by the other fields.

The returned value is a number, whose meaning depends on your system.
In POSIX, Windows, and some other systems,
this number counts the number of seconds since some given start time (the "epoch").
In other systems, the meaning is not specified,
and the number returned by time can be used only as an argument to `os.date` and `os.difftime`.

When called with a record `os.timedesc`, `os.time` also normalizes all the fields,
so that they represent the same time as before the call but with values inside their valid ranges.

### os.tmpname

```nelua
function os.tmpname(): string
```

Returns a string with a file name that can be used for a temporary file.

The file must be explicitly opened before its use and explicitly removed when no longer needed.
In POSIX systems, this function also creates a file with that name, to avoid security risks.
(Someone else might create the file with wrong permissions in the time between getting the name and creating the file.)
You still have to open the file to use it and to remove it (even if you do not use it).
When possible, you may prefer to use `io.tmpfile`, which automatically removes the file when the program ends.

### os.now

```nelua
function os.now(): number
```

Get time elapsed in seconds since its first call using a high resolution timer.
Returns a number greater than or equal to `0` on success, otherwise `-1`.

In the first successful call `0` is returned,
in subsequent calls the relative time in seconds since the first call is returned.
This is typically used to compute time differences with high precision.

The time resolution is unspecified and depends on the OS,
but typically has nanosecond precision on POSIX systems.

The operation may not be supported by all systems, or may fail in some systems,
in that case `-1` is returned.

### os.sleep

```nelua
function os.sleep(secs: number): boolean
```

Sleep the current OS thread for `secs` seconds.
Returns true on success, otherwise false.

The operation typically has at least millisecond precision,
the sleep time will be typically the requested one,
but can be a little lower or higher depending on the system.

The operation may not be supported by all systems, or may fail in some systems,
in that case false is returned.

---
## span

The span library provides the span generic.

A span is used as a view to elements of a contiguous memory block.
Contiguous containers like vector, sequence and array can be viewed as a span.
Span elements start at index 0 and go up to length-1 (like fixed arrays).

Spans are especially useful for making functions with arguments that
are agnostic to the input container type.

Spans are also known as "fat pointer" or "slice" in some other languages.

### spanT

```nelua
local spanT: type = @record{
    data: *[0]T,
    size: usize
  }
```

Span record defined when instantiating the generic `span` with type `T`.

### spanT:empty

```nelua
function spanT:empty(): boolean
```

Returns `true` if the span is empty, that is, its length is `0`.

### spanT:valid

```nelua
function spanT:valid(): boolean
```

Returns `true` if the span is not empty and has a valid data pointer.

### spanT:sub

```nelua
function spanT:sub(i: usize, j: usize): spanT
```

Returns the sub span that starts at `i` (inclusive) and continues until `j` (exclusive).
Both `i` and `j` must be in the span bounds and the expression `i <= j` must be true.

*Remarks*: When using the GC the sub span will not hold reference to the original span data,
thus if you don't hold the original reference somewhere you will have a dangling reference.

### spanT:__atindex

```nelua
function spanT:__atindex(i: usize): *T
```

Returns the reference of element at index `i`.
Argument `i` must be less than span size.
Used when indexing elements with square brackets (`[]`).

### spanT:__len

```nelua
function spanT:__len(): isize
```

Returns the number of elements in the span.

### spanT.__convert

```nelua
function spanT.__convert(values: spanT_convertible_concept): spanT
```

Initializes a span from a pointer to contiguous containers.

### span

```nelua
global span: type
```

Generic used to instantiate a span type in the form of `span(T)`.

Argument `T` is the value type that the span will store.

---
## string

The string library provides functions to manipulate strings.

String points to an immutable contiguous sequence of characters.
Internally it just holds a pointer to a buffer and a size.
It's buffer is zero terminated by default to have more compatibility with C.

The string type is defined by the compiler, however it does not have
its methods implemented, this module implements all string methods.

When the GC is disabled, you should call `string.destroy` to free the string memory
of non views strings returned by this library, otherwise the memory will leak.
Note that string literals points to a buffer in the program static storage
and such strings should never be destroyed.

Note that all string methods are 1-indexed (like Lua).

### string

```nelua
global string = @record{
  data: *[0]byte,
  size: usize,
}
```

The string record defined in the compiler sources.

New strings always have the `data` buffer null terminated by default
to have more comparability with C APIs.
The `data` buffer is 0-indexed (unlike string APIs).
### string.create

```nelua
function string.create(size: usize): string
```

Allocate a new string to be filled with length `size`.

The string is guaranteed to be zero terminated,
so it can safely be used as a `cstring`.
The string data is not initialized.

### string:destroy

```nelua
function string:destroy(): void
```

Destroys a string freeing its memory.

This must never be called on string literals.
This function is only needed to be called when not using the GC.

### string.copy

```nelua
function string.copy(s: string): string
```

Clone a string, allocating new space.

This is useful in case you want to own the string memory,
so you can modify it or manually manage its memory when GC is disabled.

### string.byte

```nelua
function string.byte(s: string, i: facultative(isize)): byte
```

Returns the internal numeric codes of the character at position `i`.

### string.sub

```nelua
function string.sub(s: string, i: isize, j: facultative(isize)): string
```

Returns the substring of `s` that starts at `i` and continues until `j` (both inclusive).
Both `i` and `j` can be negative.
If `j` is absent, then it is assumed to be equal to `-1` (which is the same as the string length).
In particular, the call `string.sub(s,1,j)` returns a prefix of `s` with length `j`,
and `string.sub(s, -i)` (for a positive `i`) returns a suffix of `s` with length `i`.

### string.subview

```nelua
function string.subview(s: string, i: isize, j: facultative(isize)): string
```

Return a view for a sub string in a string.

The main difference between this and `string.sub` is that here we don't allocate a new string,
instead it reuses its memory as an optimization.
Use this only if you know what you are doing, to be safe use `string.sub` instead.

*Remarks*: When using the GC the view will not hold reference to the original string,
thus if you don't hold the original string reference somewhere you will have a dangling reference.
The view string may not be zero terminated, thus you should never
cast it to a `cstring` to use in C functions.

### string.rep

```nelua
function string.rep(s: string, n: isize, sep: facultative(string)): string
```

Returns a string that is the concatenation of `n` copies of the string `s` separated by the string `sep`.
The default value for `sep` is the empty string (that is, no separator).
Returns the empty string if `n` is not positive.

### string.reverse

```nelua
function string.reverse(s: string): string
```

Returns a string that is the string `s` reversed.

### string.upper

```nelua
function string.upper(s: string): string
```

Receives a string and returns a copy of this string with all lowercase letters changed to uppercase.
All other characters are left unchanged.
The definition of what a lowercase letter is depends on the current locale
only if pragma `useclocale` is set.

### string.lower

```nelua
function string.lower(s: string): string
```

Receives a string and returns a copy of this string with all uppercase letters changed to lowercase.
All other characters are left unchanged.
The definition of what an uppercase letter is depends on the current locale
only if pragma `useclocale` is set.

### string.char

```nelua
function string.char(...: varargs): string
```

Receives zero or more integers and returns a string with length equal to the number of arguments,
in which each character has the internal numeric code equal to its corresponding argument.
Numeric codes are not necessarily portable across platforms.

### string.format

```nelua
function string.format(fmt: string, ...: varargs): string
```

Returns a formatted version of its variable number of arguments following the description
given in its first argument, which must be a string.
The format string follows the same rules as the ISO C function `sprintf`.
The only differences are that the conversion specifiers and modifiers `*, h, L, l` are not supported.

### string.len

```nelua
function string.len(s: string): isize
```

Receives a string and returns its length.
The empty string "" has length 0. Embedded zeros are counted.

### string.fillcstring

```nelua
function string.fillcstring(s: string, buf: *[0]cchar, buflen: usize): boolean
```

Fills a `cstring` buffer.
This is mainly used to ensure the string is zero terminated.

Returns `true` in case of success, otherwise `false` when the `buflen` is not enough.

### string.span

```nelua
function string.span(s: string): span(byte)
```

Converts a string to a span of bytes.

Remarks: Similar to `subview` a reference of the current string data is returned.

### string:__close

```nelua
function string:__close(): void
```

Effectively the same as `destroy`, called when a to-be-closed variable goes out of scope.

### string.__atindex

```nelua
function string.__atindex(s: string, i: usize): *byte
```

Returns the reference of byte representing the character at index `i`.
Argument `i` must be an integer between 1 and the string size.
Used when indexing elements with square brackets (`[]`).

### string.find

```nelua
function string.find(s: string, pattern: string, init: facultative(isize), plain: facultative(boolean)): (isize, isize)
```

Look for the first match of pattern in the string.

Returns the indices of where this occurrence starts and ends.

The indices will be positive if a match is found, zero otherwise.
A third, optional argument specifies where to start the search, its default value is 1 and can be negative.
A value of true as a fourth, optional argument plain turns off the pattern matching facilities.

### string.gmatch

```nelua
function string.gmatch(s: string, pattern: string, init: facultative(isize)): (auto, auto, string)
```

Returns an iterator function that, each time it is called, returns the whole match plus a span of captures.
A third, optional argument specifies where to start the search, its default value is 1 and can be negative.

### string.gmatchview

```nelua
function string.gmatchview(s: string, pattern: string, init: facultative(isize)): (auto, auto, string)
```

Like `string.gmatch` but uses sub string views (see also `string.subview`).

### string.gsub

```nelua
function string.gsub(s: string, pattern: string, repl: auto, maxn: facultative(isize)): (string, isize)
```

Returns a copy of `s` in which all (or the first `n`, if given) occurrences of the pattern
have been replaced by a replacement string specified by `repl`,
which can be a string, a string hashmap, or a function.
`gsub` also returns, as its second value, the total number of matches that occurred.

The name `gsub` comes from Global SUBstitution.

* If `repl` is a string, then its value is used for replacement.
The character '% works as an escape character: any sequence in `repl` of the form '%d',
with d between 1 and 9, stands for the value of the d-th captured substring;
the sequence '%0' stands for the whole match; the sequence '%%' stands for a single %.

If `repl` is a hashmap of strings, then it is queried for every match,
using the first capture as the key and its hashmap value as the replacement string,
if the.

If `repl` is a function, then this function is called every time a match occurs
with all captured substrings passed as arguments, in order.
In any case, if the pattern specifies no captures,
then it behaves as if the whole pattern was inside a capture.

If the value returned by the table query or by the function call is a string or a number,
then it is used as the replacement string;
otherwise, if it is false or nil, then there is no replacement (that is, the original match is kept in the string).

### string.match

```nelua
function string.match(s: string, pattern: string, init: facultative(isize)): (boolean, sequence(string))
```

Look for the first match of pattern in the string.
If it finds one, then returns true plus a sequence with the captured values,
otherwise it returns false plus an empty sequence.
If pattern specifies no captures, then the whole match is captured.
A third, optional argument specifies where to start the search, its default value is 1 and can be negative.

### string.matchview

```nelua
function string.matchview(s: string, pattern: string, init: facultative(isize)): (boolean, sequence(string))
```

Like `string.match` but uses sub string views (see also `string.subview`).

### string.pack

```nelua
function string.pack(fmt: string, ...: varargs): string
```

Returns a binary string containing the values in `...`,
serialized in binary form (packed) according to the format string `fmt`.

For description of the format options,
see [Lua's format strings for pack](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.4/manual.html#6.4.2).

### string.unpack

```nelua
function string.unpack(fmt: string <comptime>, s: string, init: facultative(isize))
```

Returns the values packed in string `s` (see `string.pack`) according to the format string `fmt`.
An optional `init` marks where to start reading in `s` (default is `1`).
After the read values, this function also returns the index of the first unread byte in `s`.

For description of the format options,
see [Lua's format strings for pack](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.4/manual.html#6.4.2).

Remarks: `fmt` must be a compile-time string.

### string.packsize

```nelua
function string.packsize(fmt: string): isize
```

Returns the size of a string resulting from string.pack with the given format.
The format string cannot have the variable-length options 's' or 'z'.

For description of the format options,
see [Lua's format strings for pack](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.4/manual.html#6.4.2).

### tostring

```nelua
global function tostring(x: auto): string
```

Convert a value to a string.
A new string will be always allocated.
When calling on records the `__tostring` metamethod may be called,
in this case, it must always return a new allocated string.

## stringbuilder

The string builder library allows high-performance composition of string-like data.

Unlike strings, which are immutable, string builders are mutable sequences of bytes.
The convenient string builder API simplifies common string composing tasks
that would otherwise require creating many intermediate strings.

String builders improve performance by eliminating redundant memory copies,
object creation, and garbage collection overhead.

### stringbuilderT

```nelua
local stringbuilderT: type = @record{
    data: span(byte),
    size: usize,
    allocator: Allocator
  }
```

String builder record defined when instantiating the generic `stringbuilder`.

### stringbuilderT.make

```nelua
function stringbuilderT.make(allocator: Allocator): stringbuilderT
```

Creates a string builder using a custom allocator instance.
Useful only when using instanced allocators.

### stringbuilderT:destroy

```nelua
function stringbuilderT:destroy(): void
```

Free string builder resources and resets it to a zeroed state.
Useful only when not using the garbage collector.

### stringbuilderT:__close

```nelua
function stringbuilderT:__close(): void
```

Effectively the same as `destroy`, called when a to-be-closed variable goes out of scope.

### stringbuilderT:clear

```nelua
function stringbuilderT:clear(): void
```

Clears the internal written buffer of the string builder, leaving it empty.
The internal buffer is not freed, and it may be reused.

### stringbuilderT:prepare

```nelua
function stringbuilderT:prepare(n: usize): span(byte)
```

Prepares to append at least `n` bytes into the internal writing buffer.
Returns a span that can be used to write bytes to.
Typically the returned span length will have at least `n` bytes,
but may have more to facilitate efficient buffer growth.
If there is not enough space to allocate then the span length will be 0.

After calling `prepare` and writing bytes to its returned span,
the `commit` function must be called subsequently to advance the internal writing buffer.

### stringbuilderT:commit

```nelua
function stringbuilderT:commit(n: usize): void
```

Commits `n` previously written bytes effectively advancing the internal writing buffer.
A call to `prepare` must be preceded before calling this function, and its
returned span length must have at least `n` bytes.

### stringbuilderT:rollback

```nelua
function stringbuilderT:rollback(n: usize): void
```

Removes `n` previously written bytes effectively rewinding the internal writing buffer.
The internal buffer must have at least `n` bytes.

### stringbuilderT:resize

```nelua
function stringbuilderT:resize(n: usize): boolean
```

Resizes the internal writing buffer to `n` bytes, and sets the writing position to its end.
When growing new elements will be zeroed.
Returns `true` in case of success, otherwise `false` when out of buffer memory space.

### stringbuilderT:writebyte

```nelua
function stringbuilderT:writebyte(c: byte, n: facultative(usize)): boolean
```

Appends byte `c` to the internal writing buffer.
In case `n` is present, then that amount of bytes is added, otherwise one byte is added.
Returns `true` in case of success, otherwise `false` when out of buffer memory space.

### stringbuilderT:write

```nelua
function stringbuilderT:write(...: varargs): (boolean, usize)
```

Appends values to the internal writing buffer.
The arguments must be a string, convertible to string, or a span o bytes.
Returns `true` in case of success plus the number of bytes written,
otherwise `false` when out of buffer memory space.

### stringbuilderT:writef

```nelua
function stringbuilderT:writef(fmt: string, ...: varargs): (boolean, usize)
```

Appends a formatted string to the internal writing buffer.
Returns `true` in case of success plus the number of bytes written,
otherwise `false` when out of buffer memory space.
The `fmt` string is expected to be a valid format, it should follow `string.format` rules.

### stringbuilderT:view

```nelua
function stringbuilderT:view(): string
```

Returns a string view of the current written bytes so far.
No allocation is done.

### stringbuilderT:promote

```nelua
function stringbuilderT:promote(): string
```

Promote a `stringbuilder` to a `string`.
The allocated internal buffer memory is forwarded to the string,
and then the string builder is destroyed.

This is typically used as an optimization to skip an extra allocating
when finishing building a string.
This method is only available for the default string builder.

### stringbuilderT:__len

```nelua
function stringbuilderT:__len(): isize
```

Returns the number of bytes in the internal writing buffer.
Used by the length operator (`#`).

### stringbuilderT:__tostring

```nelua
function stringbuilderT:__tostring(): string
```

Converts the string builder to a new `string`.
The operation allocates new space for the returned string.

### stringbuilder

```nelua
global stringbuilder: type
```

The default string builder using `DefaultAllocator`.

This type can also be used as a generic in the form of `stringbuilder(Allocator)`,
where `Allocator` is an allocator type for the string builder buffer.

---
## traits

The traits library provides utilities to gather type information.

### traits

```nelua
global traits: type = @record{}
```

Namespace for traits module.

### traits.typeid

```nelua
global traits.typeid: type = @uint32
```

Type of the identifier for types.

### traits.typeinfo

```nelua
global traits.typeinfo: type = @record{
  id: traits.typeid,
  name: string,
  nickname: string,
  codename: string
}
```

Record for type information.

### traits.typeidof

```nelua
function traits.typeidof(v: auto): traits.typeid
```

Returns the `typeid` of `v`.
The given `v` can be either a runtime value or a compile-time type.

### traits.typeinfoof

```nelua
function traits.typeinfoof(v: auto): traits.typeinfo
```

Returns type information of `v`.
The given `v` can be either a runtime value or a compile-time type.

### type

```nelua
global function type(v: auto): string
```

Returns the type of `v`, coded as a string, as follows:
* `"nil"` for `niltype`
* `"pointer"` for pointers and `nilptr`
* `"number"` for scalar types (including enums)
* `"string"` for types that can represent a string
* `"record"` for records
* `"union"` for unions
* `"type"` for compile-time types
* `"function"` for functions
* `"polyfunction"` for polymorphic functions

This function behaves as describe to be compatible with Lua APIs.

---
## utf8

The UTF-8 library provides basic support for UTF-8 encoding.

The library does not provide any support for Unicode other than the handling of the encoding.
Any operation that needs the meaning of a character,
such as character classification, is outside its scope.

Unless stated otherwise, all functions that expect a byte position as a parameter
assume that the given position is either the start of a byte sequence
or one plus the length of the subject string.
As in the string library, negative indices count from the end of the string.

Functions that create byte sequences accept all values up to `0x7FFFFFFF`,
as defined in the original UTF-8 specification,
that implies byte sequences of up to six bytes.

Functions that interpret byte sequences only accept valid sequences (well formed and not overlong)
By default, they only accept byte sequences that result in valid Unicode code points,
rejecting values greater than `0x10FFFF` and surrogates.
A boolean argument `relax`, when available, lifts these checks,
so that all values up to `0x7FFFFFFF` are accepted.
(Not well formed and overlong sequences are still rejected.)

### utf8

```nelua
global utf8: type = @record{}
```

Namespace for UTF-8 module.

### utf8.charpattern

```nelua
global utf8.charpattern: string
```

Pattern to match exactly one UTF-8 byte sequence, assuming that the subject is a valid UTF-8 string.

### utf8.char

```nelua
function utf8.char(...: varargs): string
```

Receives zero or more integers, converts each one to its corresponding UTF-8 byte sequence,
and returns a string with the concatenation of all these sequences.

### utf8.codes

```nelua
function utf8.codes(s: string, relax: facultative(boolean))
  : (function(string, isize): (boolean, isize, uint32), string, isize)
```

UTF-8 iterator, use to iterate over UTF-8 codes.
It returns values so that the construction
```nelua
for p, c in utf8.codes(s) do end
```
will iterate over all UTF-8 characters in string `s`,
with `p` being the position (in bytes) and `c` the code point of each character.
It raises an error if it meets any invalid byte sequence.

### utf8.codepoint

```nelua
function utf8.codepoint(s: string, i: facultative(isize), relax: facultative(boolean)): uint32
```

Returns the code point (as integer) from the characters in `s` at position `i`.
The default for `i` is `1`.
It raises an error if it meets any invalid byte sequence.

### utf8.offset

```nelua
function utf8.offset(s: string, n: isize, i: facultative(isize)): isize
```

Returns the position (in bytes) where the encoding of the n-th character of `s` starts (counting from position `i`).
A negative `n` gets characters before position `i`.
The default for `i` is `1` when `n` is non-negative and `#s + 1` otherwise,
so that `utf8.offset(s, -n)` gets the offset of the n-th character from the end of the string.
If the specified character is neither in the subject nor right after its end,
the function returns `-1`.

### utf8.len

```nelua
function utf8.len(s: string, i: facultative(isize), j: facultative(isize), relax: facultative(boolean)): (isize, isize)
```

Returns the number of UTF-8 characters in string `s` that start between positions `i` and `j` (both inclusive).
The default for `i` is `1` and for `j` is `-1`.
If it finds any invalid byte sequence, returns `-1` plus the position of the first invalid byte.

---
## coroutine

The coroutine library provides functions to manipulate coroutines.

A coroutine represents an independent "green" thread of execution.
Unlike threads in multithread systems, however,
a coroutine only suspends its execution by explicitly calling a yield function.

You create a coroutine by calling `coroutine.create`.
Its sole argument is a function that is the body function of the coroutine.
The `create` function only creates a new coroutine and returns a handle to it, it does not start the coroutine.

You execute a coroutine by calling `coroutine.resume`.
When calling a resume function the coroutine starts its execution by calling its body function.
After the coroutine starts running, it runs until it terminates or yields.

A coroutine yields by calling `coroutine.yield`.
When a coroutine yields, the corresponding resume returns immediately,
even if the yield happens inside nested function calls (that is, not in the main function).
In the case of a yield, resume also returns true.
The next time you resume the same coroutine, it continues its execution from the point where it yielded.

At the moment Nelua does not support variable arguments in `yield` and `resume` (unlikely Lua).
To pass values between resume and yield, you must use `coroutine.push` and `coroutine.pop`
with the input and output types known at compile-time.

### coroutine

```nelua
global coroutine: type = @*minicoro.Coro
```

The coroutine handle.

### coroutine.destroy

```nelua
function coroutine.destroy(co: coroutine): void
```

Destroy the coroutine `co`, freeing its stack memory and resources.

Note that this is only needed to be called when the GC is disabled.

*Remarks*: Destroying a coroutine before `"dead"` state will not execute its defer statements.

### coroutine:__close

```nelua
function coroutine:__close(): void
```

Effectively the same as `destroy`, called when a to-be-closed variable goes out of scope.

### coroutine.create

```nelua
function coroutine.create(f: function_concept): coroutine
```

Returns a new coroutine with body function `f`.
The function allocates stack memory and resources for the coroutine.
It only creates a new coroutine and returns a handle to it, it does not start the coroutine.

### coroutine.push

```nelua
function coroutine.push(co: coroutine, ...: varargs): (boolean, string)
```

Pushes multiple values into the coroutine `co` storage, returning `true` on success.

- The values can be received in the next `coroutine.pop` or in the body function arguments (when coroutine starts).
- In case of an error returns `false` plus the error message.
- The user is responsible to always use the right types and push/pop order and count.

### coroutine.pop

```nelua
function coroutine.pop(co: coroutine, ...: varargs): (boolean, string)
```

Pops multiple values from the coroutine `co` storage, returning `true` on success.

- Only pointers to values are expected in extra arguments,
and they should follow the same order of the last `coroutine.push`.
- The retrieved values was either set by the last `coroutine.pop` or returned by its body function (when coroutine finishes).
- In case of an error, return `false` plus the error message, and the values may not be set.
- The user is responsible to always use the right types and push/pop order and count.

### coroutine.isyieldable

```nelua
function coroutine.isyieldable(co: coroutine): boolean
```

Checks whether the coroutine `co` can yield.

A coroutine is yieldable if it isn't the main thread.

### coroutine.resume

```nelua
function coroutine.resume(co: coroutine, ...: varargs): (boolean, string)
```

Starts or continues the execution of the coroutine `co`.

- The first time you resume a coroutine, it starts running its body function.
- Extra arguments `...` are pushed before resuming.
- If the coroutine has yielded, resume continues it.
- If the coroutine runs without any errors, resume returns `true` plus an empty error message.
- If there is any error, resume returns `false` plus the error message.
- Values passed to the last yield should be retrieved with `coroutine.pop`.

### coroutine.spawn

```nelua
function coroutine.spawn(f: function_concept, ...: varargs): coroutine
```

Creates and immediately starts a new coroutine with body function `f`.

Extra arguments are passed to the function `f` arguments.
This is effectively the same as calling `coroutine.create` and then `coroutine.resume`.

### coroutine.yield

```nelua
function coroutine.yield(...: varargs): void
```

Suspends the execution of the running coroutine.

- On failure raises an error.
- Extra arguments `...` are pushed before yielding.
- Values passed to last resume should be retrieved with `coroutine.pop`.

### coroutine.running

```nelua
function coroutine.running(): (coroutine, boolean)
```

Returns the running coroutine plus a boolean that is true when the running coroutine is the main one.

### coroutine.status

```nelua
function coroutine.status(co: coroutine): string
```

Returns the status of the coroutine `co`.

The status string can be any of the following:

* `"running"`, if the coroutine is running (that is, it is the one that called status).
* `"suspended"`, if the coroutine is suspended in a call to yield, or if it has not started running yet.
* `"normal"` if the coroutine is active but not running (that is, it has resumed another coroutine).
* `"dead"` if the coroutine has finished its body function, or if it has been destroyed.

## hash

The hash library provides utilities to generate hash for values.

The included hash functions in this library are intended to be used containers such as `hashmap` and `table`,
thus the hash functions are designed to be fast, and are not necessarily equal across platforms
and may skip bytes.
Use a better hash algorithm in case you need deterministic hash across platforms
and with better quality.

### hash

```nelua
global hash: type = @record{}
```

Namespace for hash module.

### hash.short

```nelua
function hash.short(data: span(byte)): usize
```

This function can be slow for long spans.

### hash.long

```nelua
function hash.long(data: span(byte)): usize
```

Hashes a span of bytes, iterating at most 32 bytes evenly spaced.
This function can be fast to hash long spans, at cost of hash quality.

### hash.combine

```nelua
function hash.combine(seed: usize, value: usize): usize
```

Returns the combination of the hashes `seed` and `value`.

### hash.hash

```nelua
function hash.hash(v: auto): usize
```

Hashes value `v`, used to hash anything.

To customize a hash for a specific record you can define `__hash` metamethod,
and it will be used when calling this function.

---
## vector

The vector library provides an efficient dynamic sized array of values.

A vector has the following semantics:
* Its elements starts at index 0 and go up to its length minus 1.

---
## sequence

The sequence library provides a dynamic sized array of values,
like vector, but with the following semantics:

* Its elements starts at position 1 and go up to its length (like lua tables).
* Internally it just contains a pointer,
thus the list itself is passed by reference by default (like lua tables again).
* Indexing the next elements after the end makes the sequence grow automatically.

---
## list

The list library provides a double linked list container.

A double linked list is a dynamic sized container that supports
constant time insertion and removal from anywhere in the container.
Doubled linked lists don't support fast random access,
use a vector or sequence in that case.

function listT:__next(node: *listnodeT): (boolean, *listnodeT, T)
```

Returns the next node of the list and its element.
Used with `pairs()` iterator.

### listT:__mnext

```nelua
function listT:__mnext(node: *listnodeT): (boolean, *listnodeT, *T)
```

Returns the next node of the list and its element by reference.
Used with `mpairs()` iterator.

### listT:__pairs

global list: type
```

Generic used to instantiate a list type in the form of `list(T, Allocator)`.

Argument `Allocator` is an allocator type for the container storage,
in case absent then then `DefaultAllocator` is used.

---
## hashmap

The hashmap library provides a hash table with fixed types.

A hash map is an associative container that contains key-value pairs with unique keys.
Search, insertion, and removal of elements have average constant-time complexity.

The hash map share similarities with Lua tables but should not be used like them,
the main differences are:
 * There is no array part.
 * The length operator returns number of elements in the map.
 * Indexing automatically inserts a key-value pair, to avoid this use `peek()` method.
 * Values cannot be `nil` or set to `nil`.
 * Can only use `pairs()` to iterate.

Any failure when growing a hash map raises an error.

### hashnodeT

```nelua
local hashnodeT: type = @record{
    key: K,
    value: V,
    filled: boolean,
    next: usize,
  }
```

Hash map node record defined when instantiating the generic `hashmap`.

### hashmapT

```nelua
local hashmapT: type = @record{
    buckets: span(usize),
    nodes: span(hashnodeT),
    size: usize,
    free_index: usize,
    allocator: Allocator
  }
```

Hash map record defined when instantiating the generic `hashmap`.

### hashmapT.make

```nelua
function hashmapT.make(allocator: Allocator): hashmapT
```

Creates a hash map using a custom allocator instance.
Useful only when using instanced allocators.

### hashmapT:destroy

```nelua
function hashmapT:destroy(): void
```

Resets the container to a zeroed state, freeing all used resources.

*Complexity*: O(1).

### hashmapT:__close

```nelua
function hashmapT:__close(): void
```

Effectively the same as `destroy`, called when a to-be-closed variable goes out of scope.

### hashmapT:clear

```nelua
function hashmapT:clear(): void
```

Remove all elements from the container.
The internal storage buffers are not freed, and they may be reused.

*Complexity*: O(n).

### hashmapT:_find

```nelua
function hashmapT:_find(key: K): (usize, usize, usize)
```

Used internally to find a value at a key returning it's node index.

### hashmapT:rehash

```nelua
function hashmapT:rehash(bucket_count: usize): void
```

Sets the number of buckets to at least `bucket_count` and rehashes the container when needed.
The number of new buckets will always be at least
the smallest appropriate value to not exceed the maximum load factor,
thus rehashing with 0 `bucket_count` can be used to shrink the hash map.

Rehash invalidates all references to element values previously returned.

*Complexity*: Average case O(n).

### hashmapT:reserve

```nelua
function hashmapT:reserve(count: usize): void
```

Sets the number of buckets to the number needed to accommodate at least `count` elements
without exceeding maximum load factor and rehashes the container when needed.

*Complexity*: Average case O(n).

### hashmapT:_at

```nelua
function hashmapT:_at(key: K): usize
```

Used internally to find or make a value at a key returning it's node index.

### hashmapT:__atindex

```nelua
function hashmapT:__atindex(key: K): *V
```

Returns a reference to the value that is mapped to a key.
If such key does not exist, then it's inserted and a rehash may happen.
The reference will remain valid until next rehash (when growing).
This allows indexing the hash map with square brackets `[]`.

*Complexity*: Average case O(1).

### hashmapT:peek

```nelua
function hashmapT:peek(key: K): *V
```

Returns a reference to the value that is mapped to a key.
If no such element exists, returns `nilptr`.
The reference will remain valid until next rehash (when growing).

*Complexity*: Average case O(1).

### hashmapT:remove

```nelua
function hashmapT:remove(key: K): V
```

Removes an element with a key from the container (if it exists).
Returns the removed value that was was actually removed.
If the key does not exist, then returns a zeroed value.

It's safe to remove an element while iterating.
References to element values previously returned will remain valid.

*Complexity*: Average case O(1).

### hashmapT:loadfactor

```nelua
function hashmapT:loadfactor(): number
```

Returns the average number of elements per bucket.

### hashmapT:bucketcount

```nelua
function hashmapT:bucketcount(): usize
```

Returns the number of buckets in the container.

### hashmapT:capacity

```nelua
function hashmapT:capacity(): usize
```

Returns the number of elements the container can store before triggering a rehash.

### hashmapT:__len

```nelua
function hashmapT:__len(): isize
```

```

Allow using `mpairs()` to iterate the container.

### hashmapT:_next_node

```nelua
function hashmapT:_next_node(key: facultative(K)): *hashnodeT
```

Used internally by `__next` and `__mnext`.

### hashmapT:__next

```nelua
function hashmapT:__next(key: facultative(K)): (boolean, K, V)
```

Allow using `next()` to iterate the container.

### hashmapT:__mnext

```nelua
function hashmapT:__mnext(key: facultative(K)): (boolean, K, *V)
```

Allow using `mnext()` to iterate the container.

### hashmap

```nelua
global hashmap: type
```

Generic used to instantiate a hash map type in the form of `hashmap(K, V, HashFunc, Allocator)`.

Argument `K` is the key type for the hash map.
Argument `V` is the value type for the hash map.
Argument `HashFunc` is a function to hash a key,
in case absent then `hash.hash` is used.
Argument `Allocator` is an allocator type for the container storage,

## allocators.default

The default allocator library provides the default allocator used by the standard libraries.

The default allocator is `GCAllocator` when GC is enabled,
otherwise `GeneralAllocator` (when using the pragma `nogc`).

When disabling the GC the user is responsible for manually deallocating
unused memory from the default allocator.

### new

```nelua
global function new(what: auto, size: facultative(usize)): auto
```

Shorthand for `default_allocator:new`.
For details see also `Allocator:new`.

### delete

```nelua
global function delete(v: auto): void
```

Shorthand for `default_allocator:delete`.
For details see also `Allocator:delete`.

---
## allocators.allocator

Allocator interface library provides common functions implemented on every allocator.

This library is not an allocator by itself, but it's used by other
allocators.

* A method with '0' suffix initializes the memory with zeros.
* A method with 'x' prefix raises an error in case of an allocation failure.
* A method with 'span' prefix returns a span, instead of a pointer.

Allocation failures usually happen when running out of memory.

### Allocator

```nelua
local Allocator: type
```

The allocator type which the allocator interface will implements the methods.

### Allocator:alloc

```nelua
function Allocator:alloc(size: usize): pointer
```

Allocates `size` bytes and returns a pointer of the allocated memory block.

- The allocated memory is not initialized.
- If `size` is zero or the operation fails, then returns `nilptr`.

### Allocator:xalloc

```nelua
function Allocator:xalloc(size: usize): pointer
```

Like `alloc`, but raises an error in case the allocation fails.

### Allocator:alloc0

```nelua
function Allocator:alloc0(size: usize): pointer
```

Like `alloc`, but the allocated memory is initialized with zeros.

### Allocator:xalloc0

```nelua
function Allocator:xalloc0(size: usize): pointer
```

Like `alloc0`, but raises an error in case the allocation fails.

### Allocator:dealloc

```nelua
function Allocator:dealloc(p: pointer): void
```

Deallocates the allocated memory block pointed by `p`.

- If `p` is `nilptr`, then no operation is performed.
- The `dealloc(p)` has been already been called before, then undefined behavior occurs.
- Unless `p` is `nilptr`,
it must have been returned by an earlier allocation call from this allocator.

### Allocator:realloc

```nelua
function Allocator:realloc(p: pointer, newsize: usize, oldsize: usize): pointer
```

Changes the size of the memory block pointer by `p` from size `oldsize` bytes to `newsize` bytes.

- The allocated memory contents will be unchanged from the start of the region
up to the minimum of the `oldsize` and `newsize`.
- If `newsize` is larger than the `oldsize`, the added memory is not initialized.
- If `p` is `nilptr`, the call is equivalent to `alloc(newsize)`.
- If `newsize` is equal to `oldsize`, then no operation is performed.
- If `newsize` is zero, the call is equivalent to `dealloc(p)`.
- If the operation fails, then the original `p` is left untouched, it's not deallocated or moved,
and `nilptr` is returned.
- The returned pointer may be the same as `p` if the allocation was not moved,
or different from `p` if the allocation was moved to a new address.
- Unless `p` is `nilptr`,
it must have been returned by an earlier allocation call from this allocator.

### Allocator:xrealloc

```nelua
function Allocator:xrealloc(p: pointer, newsize: usize, oldsize: usize): pointer
```

Like `realloc`, but raises an error in case the allocation fails.

### Allocator:realloc0

```nelua
function Allocator:realloc0(p: pointer, newsize: usize, oldsize: usize): pointer
```

Like `realloc`, but initializes added memory with zeros.

### Allocator:xrealloc0

```nelua
function Allocator:xrealloc0(p: pointer, newsize: usize, oldsize: usize): pointer
```

Like `realloc0`, but raises an error in case the allocation fails.

### Allocator:spanalloc

```nelua
function Allocator:spanalloc(T: type, size: usize): auto
```

Like `alloc`, but returns a span of `T` with `size` elements.

- The allocated memory region will have `size * #T` bytes.
- If the operation fails, then an empty span is returned.

### Allocator:xspanalloc

```nelua
function Allocator:xspanalloc(T: type, size: usize): auto
```

Like `spanalloc`, but raises an error in case the allocation fails.

### Allocator:spanalloc0

```nelua
function Allocator:spanalloc0(T: type, size: usize): auto
```

Like `spanalloc`, but initializes added memory with zeros.

### Allocator:xspanalloc0

```nelua
function Allocator:xspanalloc0(T: type, size: usize): auto
```

Like `spanalloc0`, but raises an error in case the allocation fails.

### Allocator:spandealloc

```nelua
function Allocator:spandealloc(s: span_concept): void
```

Like `dealloc`, but operates over a span.

### Allocator:spanrealloc

```nelua
function Allocator:spanrealloc(s: span_concept, size: usize): auto
```

Like `realloc`, but operate over a span.

If the operation fails and `size > 0`,
then the memory region is left untouched and span `s` is returned,
thus to check for an allocation failure you have to compare
if the returned span size is different than `size`.

### Allocator:xspanrealloc

```nelua
function Allocator:xspanrealloc(s: span_concept, size: usize): auto
```

Like `spanrealloc`, but raises an error in case the allocation fails.

### Allocator:spanrealloc0

```nelua
function Allocator:spanrealloc0(s: span_concept, size: usize): auto
```

Like `spanrealloc`, but initializes added memory with zeros.

### Allocator:xspanrealloc0

```nelua
function Allocator:xspanrealloc0(s: span_concept, size: usize): auto
```

Like `spanrealloc0`, but raises an error in case the allocation fails.

### Allocator:new

```nelua
function Allocator:new(what: auto, size: facultative(usize)): auto
```

Allocates a new value.

- Argument `what` must be either a compile-time type or a runtime initialized value.
- If `what` is a runtime value, the return value will have the same type,
and it's contents are copied into the new allocated value.
- If `what` is a compile-time type, the returned value will be of `what` type,
and its contents are zero initialized.
- If the operation fails, then an error is raised.
- If `size` is present, then returns a span with `size` elements of `what`, instead of a pointer.
- In case the value has the `__new` metamethod, it will be called immediately after the allocation.
- In case the value has a finalizer, and the allocator supports finalizers,
such as `GCAllocator`, the value is marked to be finalized when deallocated.

### Allocator:delete

```nelua
function Allocator:delete(v: deleteable_concept): void
```

Deletes value `v`, which must be either a pointer or a span.

It's similar to `dealloc` or `spandealloc`,
but `delete` should only be used when `new` is used for the same allocation.
If the deleted values has `__delete` metamethod, then it's called
before deletion.

---
## allocators.general

The general allocator uses the system's general purpose allocator to allocate dynamic memory,
usually this an efficient allocator for the general use case.
It uses the allocation functions provided by the system.

The general allocator can also be overridden by an allocator instance in case

For more details see `Allocator:alloc`.

This function calls system's `malloc()`.

### GeneralAllocator:alloc0

```nelua
function GeneralAllocator:alloc0(size: usize): pointer
```

Like `alloc`, but the allocated memory is initialized with zeros.

This function calls system's `realloc()`.

---
## allocators.gc

The garbage collector allocator provides automatic memory management.

With this allocator you don't have to worry about deallocating
objects that are no longer needed.
It manages memory automatically by running a garbage collector
from time to time to collect all dead pointers
(that is, pointers that are no longer accessible in the heap or stack).

Only memory allocated by this allocator is subject to automatic management.

The collector implements a simple mark-and-sweep garbage collector.
It's a stop-the-world garbage collector, that is,
it may halt execution of the program to run a collection cycle.
It is a conservative garbage collector, that is,
it scans the heap and stack memory assuming any bit pattern could be a pointer.

The collector has one number to control its garbage-collection cycle,
the garbage collector pause,
it controls how long the collector waits before starting a new cycle.
Larger values make the collector less aggressive.
The default value of 200 means that the collector
waits for the total memory in use to double before starting a new cycle.
Values smaller than 100 mean the collector will not wait to start a new cycle.

### GCFlags

```nelua
global GCFlags: type = @enum(usize) {
  MARK = 1, -- Marked for collection (used only internally).
  ROOT = 2, -- Allocation always scanned and it is never collected.
  LEAF = 4, -- Allocation never scanned, that is, contains no pointers.
  EXTERN = 8, -- External allocation, used to scan external allocations.
}
```

Possible flags to set when registering a new pointer in the allocator.

### GC

```nelua
global GC: type = @record{
  running: boolean,  -- Whether the collector is running.
  collecting: boolean, -- Whether a collecting cycle is actively running.
  pause: usize, -- The collector pause (default 200).
  membytes: usize, -- Total allocated memory currently being tracked by the GC (in bytes).
  lastmembytes: usize, -- Total allocated memory tracked just after the last collection cycle.
  minaddr: usize, -- Minimum pointer address tracked by the GC.
  maxaddr: usize, -- Maximum pointer address tracked by the GC.
  stacktop: usize, -- Stack top address.
  stackbottom: usize, -- Stack bottom address.
  frees: vector(pointer, GeneralAllocator), -- List of pointers to be freed.
  markranges: vector(GCMarkRange, GeneralAllocator), -- List of ranges to be scanned.
  items: hashmap(pointer, GCItem, nil, GeneralAllocator), -- Map of all tracked allocations.
}
```

The garbage collector record.

### gc

```nelua
global gc: GC
```

The global GC instance.

### GC:unregister

```nelua
function GC:unregister(ptr: pointer, finalize: facultative(boolean)): void
```

Unregister pointer `ptr` from the GC.
If `finalize` is `true` and the pointer has a finalizer, then it's called.

### GC:collect

```nelua
function GC:collect(): void
```

Performs a full garbage collection cycle.
This halts the application until a the collection is finished.
All collected items are finalized and deallocated.
The finalization or deallocation order is random

### GC:step

```nelua
function GC:step(): boolean
```

Trigger a collection cycle when the memory has grown above pause threshold.

### GC:register

```nelua
function GC:register(ptr: pointer, size: usize, flags: usize,
                     finalizer: function(pointer, pointer): void, userdata: pointer): void
```

Register pointer `ptr` with `size` bytes into the GC.
If `finalizer` is present, then it will be called when the pointer is collected.

### GC:reregister

```nelua
function GC:reregister(oldptr: pointer, newptr: pointer, newsize: usize): void
```

Register pointer that moved from `oldptr` to `newptr` with new size `newsize`.
Called when reallocating a pointers.

### GC:setstacktop

```nelua
function GC:setstacktop(stacktop: facultative(usize)): usize
```

Set new stack top for the GC scanner and returns the previous stack top.
This may be used to support scanning from coroutines.
If `stacktop` is omitted then it will calculate it.

### GC:count

```nelua
function GC:count(): number
```

Returns the total memory size tracked by the collector (in Kbytes).
The value has a fractional part, so that it multiplied by 1024 gives the exact number of bytes.

### GC:stop

```nelua
function GC:stop(): void
```

Stops automatic execution of the garbage collector.
The collector will run only when explicitly invoked, until a call to restart it.

### GC:restart

```nelua

This is called automatically when the starting the application.

### GC:destroy

```nelua
function GC:destroy(): void
```

Destroys the garbage collector.
All allocations are finalized and deallocated.

global function collectgarbage(opt: overload(string,number,niltype) <comptime>,
                               arg: facultative(integer))
```

This function is a generic interface to the garbage collector.
It performs different functions according to its first argument, `opt`:

- `"collect"`: Performs a full garbage-collection cycle.
This is the default option.
- `"stop"`: Stops automatic execution of the garbage collector.
The collector will run only when explicitly invoked, until a call to restart it.
- `"restart"`: Restarts automatic execution of the garbage collector.
- `"count"`: Returns the total memory being tracked by the collector in Kbytes.
The value has a fractional part, so that it multiplied by 1024 gives the exact number of bytes.
- `"step"`: Performs a garbage-collection step. The collector will perform a full
collection cycle only if the memory has grown above pause threshold.
Returns `true` if a collection cycle was run.
Calling this is only useful when the GC is stopped.
- `"setpause"`: Sets `arg` as the new value for the pause of the collector.

                           userdata: facultative(pointer)): pointer
```

Allocates `size` bytes and returns a pointer of the allocated memory block.
The allocated memory is not initialized.

If `flags` is present, then it's passed to `GC:register`, see `GCFlags` for possible values.
If `finalizer` is present, then it will be called before the allocation is deallocated.
If `userdata` is present, then it's passed as a parameters to the finalizer.

For more details see `Allocator:alloc`.

### GCAllocator:alloc0

```nelua
function GCAllocator:alloc0(size: usize,
                            flags: facultative(usize),
                            finalizer: facultative(function(pointer, pointer): void),
                            userdata: facultative(pointer)): pointer
```

Like `alloc`, but the allocated memory is initialized with zeros.

### GCAllocator:dealloc

```nelua
function GCAllocator:dealloc(ptr: pointer): void
```

Deallocates the allocated memory block pointed by `ptr`.

If `ptr` has a finalizer, then it's called before deallocating.

                               userdata: facultative(pointer)): auto
```

Like `alloc`, but returns a span of `T` with `size` elements.

This function automatically sets `GCFlags.LEAF` in case `T` has no pointers,
by doing so, it can skip unnecessary memory scans, thus the GC can collect faster.

For more details see `Allocator:spanalloc`.

### GCAllocator:spanalloc0

```nelua
function GCAllocator:spanalloc0(T: type, size: usize,
                                flags: facultative(usize),
                                finalizer: facultative(function(pointer, pointer): void),

### GCAllocator:new

```nelua
function GCAllocator:new(what: auto, size: facultative(usize)): auto
```

Allocates a new value.

- Argument `what` must be either a compile-time type or a runtime initialized value.

and it's contents are copied into the new allocated value.
- If `what` is a compile-time type, the returned value will be of `what` type,
and its contents are zero initialized.
- If the operation fails, then an error is raised.
- If `size` is present, then returns a span with `size` elements of `what`, instead of a pointer.
- In case the value has the `__new` metamethod, it will be called immediately after the allocation.
- In case the value has the `__gc` metamethod, it will be called once the value is collected.

## allocators.arena

The arena allocator, sometimes also known as linear, monotonic or region allocator,
allocates everything from a fixed size contiguous buffer by incrementing
an offset every new allocation.

The purpose of this allocator is to have very fast allocations with almost
no runtime cost when the maximum used space is known ahead
and to quickly deallocate many allocated objects at once with almost no runtime cost too.

Reallocations and deallocations do not free space unless once for the last recent allocation.
To free space `deallocall` should be called when all operations on its allocations are finished.

The allocator buffer will reside on the stack when declared inside a function,
or on the static memory storage when declared in a top scope,
or on the heap if allocated by the general allocator.

When declaring on the stack there is no need to perform deallocations at the end of the scope,
just leave the scope ends to have a quick cleanup.
Also take care to not use a large buffer on the stack,
or the program may crash with not enough stack space,
on some system for example the stack is limited to 1MB.

By default allocations are aligned to 8 bytes unless explicitly told otherwise.
Remember to use the proper alignment for the allocated objects to have fast memory access.

The implementation is based on
[this article](https://www.gingerbill.org/article/2019/02/08/memory-allocation-strategies-002/).

### ArenaAllocatorT

Allocates `size` bytes and returns a pointer to the allocated memory block,
advancing the internal arena offset.

The allocated memory is not initialized.
If `size` is zero or the operation fails, then returns `nilptr`.

### ArenaAllocatorT:dealloc

```nelua
function ArenaAllocatorT:dealloc(p: pointer): void
```

Deallocates the allocated memory block pointed by `p`.

If `p` is the very last allocation,
then the internal arena offset is rewind by one allocation.

### ArenaAllocatorT:deallocall

```nelua
function ArenaAllocatorT:deallocall(): void
```

Deallocate all allocations.
rewinding the entire internal arena offset.

This operation is fast.

### ArenaAllocatorT:realloc

```nelua
function ArenaAllocatorT:realloc(p: pointer, newsize: usize, oldsize: usize): pointer
```

Changes the size of the memory block pointer by `p` from size `oldsize` bytes to `newsize` bytes.

If `p` is not the very last allocation,
then its contents are copied to a new memory block.
For more `realloc` details see also `Allocator:realloc`.

### ArenaAllocator

```nelua
global ArenaAllocator: type
```

Generic used to instantiate a arena allocator type in the form of `ArenaAllocator(SIZE, ALIGN)`.

Argument `SIZE` is the arena fixed buffer size in bytes, must be multiple of `ALIGN`.
Argument `ALIGN` is the default alignment for new allocations,
must be at least 4 and in power of two, in case absent then `8` is used.

## allocators.stack

The stack allocator, allocates everything from a fixed size contiguous buffer
by incrementing an offset every new allocation and decrementing on every
deallocation that follows the LIFO (last-in, first-out) principle.
This allocator is an evolution of the Arena allocator,
thus understand the arena allocator first before using this.

The purpose of this allocator is to have very fast allocations with almost
no runtime cost when the maximum used space is known ahead.

Deallocations out of order will cause a runtime error only on checked builds.
By default alignment should be at least 4 because this allocator stores
a header for allocation metadata with this requirement.
By default allocations are aligned to 8 bytes unless explicitly told otherwise.

The implementation is based on
[this article](https://www.gingerbill.org/article/2019/02/15/memory-allocation-strategies-003/).

### StackAllocatorT

```nelua
local StackAllocatorT: type = @record{
    prev_offset: usize,
    curr_offset: usize,
    buffer: [SIZE]byte
  }
```

Stack allocator record defined when instantiating the generic `StackAllocator`.

### StackAllocatorT:alloc

```nelua
function StackAllocatorT:alloc(size: usize): pointer
```

Allocates `size` bytes and returns a pointer to the allocated memory block,
advancing the internal stack offset.

The allocated memory is not initialized.
If `size` is zero or the operation fails, then returns `nilptr`.

### StackAllocatorT:dealloc

```nelua
function StackAllocatorT:dealloc(p: pointer): void
```

Deallocates the allocated memory block pointed by `p`,
rewinding the internal stack offset by one allocation.

Unless `p` is `nilptr`, it must be the very last allocation.

### StackAllocatorT:deallocall

```nelua
function StackAllocatorT:deallocall(): void
```

Deallocate all allocations,
rewinding the entire internal stack offset.

This operation is fast.

### StackAllocatorT:realloc

```nelua
function StackAllocatorT:realloc(p: pointer, newsize: usize, oldsize: usize): pointer
```

Changes the size of the memory block pointer by `p` from size `oldsize` bytes to `newsize` bytes,
rewinding or advancing the internal stack offset as necessary.

Unless `p` is `nilptr`, it must be the very last allocation.
For more `realloc` details see also `Allocator:realloc`.

### StackAllocator

```nelua
global StackAllocator: type
```

Generic used to instantiate a stack allocator type in the form of `StackAllocator(SIZE, ALIGN)`.

Argument `SIZE` is the fixed stack buffer size in bytes, must be multiple of `ALIGN`.
Argument `ALIGN` is the default alignment for new allocations,
must be at least 4 and in power of two, in case absent then `8` is used.

## allocators.pool

The pool allocator allocates chunks from a fixed contiguous buffer of many chunks,
allocations pop a free chunk from the pool and deallocations push a chunk back.
It works by using a single linked list of free chunks.

The purpose of this allocator is to have very fast allocations of objects with almost
no runtime cost when the maximum used space is known ahead.

Reallocations and deallocations free space (unlikely the Arena allocator).
Allocations greater than the chunk size will always fail.

The implementation is based on
[this article](https://www.gingerbill.org/article/2019/02/16/memory-allocation-strategies-004/).

### PoolAllocatorT

```nelua
local PoolAllocatorT: type = @record{
    initialized: boolean,
    head: *PoolFreeNode,
    buffer: [SIZE]PoolChunkT
  }
```

Pool allocator record defined when instantiating the generic `PoolAllocator`.

### PoolAllocatorT:alloc

```nelua
function PoolAllocatorT:alloc(size: usize): pointer
```

Allocates `size` bytes and returns a pointer to the allocated memory block,
using a free chunk from the pool.

The allocated memory is not initialized.
If `size` is greater than the size of T, then the operation fails.
If `size` is zero, then the operation fails.
If the operation fails, then returns `nilptr`.

### PoolAllocatorT:dealloc

```nelua
function PoolAllocatorT:dealloc(p: pointer): void
```

Deallocates the allocated memory block pointed by `p`,
leaving the pool chunk of `p` free to be reused in a subsequent allocation.

### PoolAllocatorT:deallocall

```nelua
function PoolAllocatorT:deallocall(): void
```

Deallocate all allocations,
leaving all pool chunks free to be reused in new allocations.

### PoolAllocatorT:realloc

```nelua
function PoolAllocatorT:realloc(p: pointer, newsize: usize, oldsize: usize): pointer
```

This function is provided just for compatibility.

Any attempt to grow the memory block will fail, returning `nilptr`.
Any attempt to shrink the memory block will be ignored, returning the same `p`.
New allocations and deallocation through this function will work normally.

### PoolAllocator

```nelua
global PoolAllocator: type
```

Generic used to instantiate a arena allocator type in the form of `PoolAllocator(T, SIZE)`.

Argument `T` is the object type in the pool.
Argument `SIZE` is the maximum number of elements in the pool.

The pool will effectively have an internal buffer with `#T * SIZE` bytes.

## allocators.heap

This is a minimal general purpose heap allocator, that could serve as replacement to
the system's general allocator. It requires a pre allocated memory region in advance.
It's purpose is to have predictable allocation and deallocation time
when you can allocate the maximum memory usage in advance.

It uses linked lists to search for the best free node.
It tries to have a fast alloc/dealloc.
However it may fragment more than other allocators.

In some cases it can be faster than the general purpose allocator.
However usually you are better off with the system's general purpose allocator.
This may be more useful to have reliable alloc/dealloc time on real time applications,
or if you want to avoid the system's default allocator for some reason,
or if the system does not have an allocator.

Its memory cannot grow automatically, use the system's general purpose allocator for that.
The allocator is not thread safe, it was designed to be used in single thread applications.
Allocations are always aligned to the platform max alignment, typically 16 bytes.

*NOTE*: This is experimental, a bunch of tests were done but is not really battle tested.

The implementation is based on
[this project](https://github.com/CCareaga/heap_allocator),
however it has heavy customized to have more performance, constant time allocations
and alignment.

### HeapAllocatorT

```nelua
local HeapAllocatorT: type = @record{
    initialized: boolean,
    heap: Heap,
    buffer: [SIZE]byte
  }
```

Heap allocator record defined when instantiating the generic `HeapAllocator`.

### HeapAllocatorT:init

```nelua
function HeapAllocatorT:init(): void
```

Initializes the heap allocator, called automatically on first `alloc`/`realloc`.

### HeapAllocatorT:alloc

```nelua
function HeapAllocatorT:alloc(size: usize): pointer
```

Allocates `size` bytes and returns a pointer to the allocated memory block.

The allocated memory is not initialized.
If `size` is zero or the operation fails, then returns `nilptr`.

### HeapAllocatorT:dealloc

```nelua
function HeapAllocatorT:dealloc(p: pointer): void
```

Deallocates the allocated memory block pointed by `p`.

If `p` is `nilptr`, then no operation is performed.
The `dealloc(p)` has been already been called before, then undefined behavior occurs.
Unless `p` is `nilptr`,
it must have been returned by an earlier allocation call from this allocator.

### HeapAllocatorT:deallocall

```nelua
function HeapAllocatorT:deallocall(): void
```

Deallocate all allocations from the heap.

### HeapAllocatorT:realloc

```nelua
function HeapAllocatorT:realloc(p: pointer, newsize: usize, oldsize: usize): pointer
```

Changes the size of the memory block pointer by `p` from size `oldsize` bytes to `newsize` bytes.

For more details see `Allocator:realloc`.

### HeapAllocator

```nelua
global HeapAllocator: type
```

Generic used to instantiate a heap allocator type in the form of `HeapAllocator(SIZE)`.

Argument `SIZE` is the size of the heap in bytes.
